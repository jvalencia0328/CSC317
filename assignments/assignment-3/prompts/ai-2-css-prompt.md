# AI-Generated CSS Prompt  

I need a full CSS file for my **personal portfolio website** based on this dark minimalist design image.  

## **Colors**  
- Main background: Black (`#000000`).  
- Secondary background: Dark gray (`#111111`) for cards and sections.  
- Text: White (`#ffffff`).  
- Accent color: Coral/salmon red (like in the image, around `#FF5A5A`).  
- Subtle borders and highlights: Dark gray (`#333333`).  

## **Fonts**  
- Use a modern, clean sans-serif font like `"Helvetica Neue"`, Arial, sans-serif.  
- Headings should be **bold with increased letter spacing**.  
- Main heading (`h1`) should be **large and impactful**.  
- Good spacing between paragraphs for readability.  

## **Layout**  
- The site should be **fully responsive** for mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
- Center the header with my profile image and name.
- Navigation links with subtle hover effects.
- **Project cards** arranged in a grid (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile).
- Good spacing between all sections for a clean, uncluttered look.
- Contact form with minimal styling but clear visual cues.

## **Styling Details**  
- Cards should have subtle shadow effects and hover animations.  
- Include the red asterisk/star element from the reference image as a design accent.
- Form inputs should be simple with bottom borders only.
- Social media links should stand out and have hover effects.
- Add smooth transitions for all interactive elements.
- Profile image should be circular with an accent-colored border.
