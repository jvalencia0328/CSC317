# AI-Generated CSS Prompt  

I need a full CSS file for my **personal portfolio website**. Hereâ€™s what I want:  

## **Colors**  
- Main color: Deep blue (`#2a3d66`).  
- Accent color: Soft cyan (`#4bb3fd`).  
- Background: Light gray (`#f8f9fa`).  
- Text: Dark gray (`#333`).  
- Links should be blue (`#007bff`) and turn a darker blue (`#0056b3`) when hovered.  

## **Fonts**  
- Use a clean, easy-to-read font like `"Poppins"`, sans-serif.  
- Headings (`h1, h2, h3`) should be **bold and capitalized**.  
- Regular text should have **line spacing** to make it easier to read.  

## **Layout**  
- The site should be **responsive**, so it looks good on all screen sizes.  
- Use **CSS Grid and Flexbox** to arrange content.  
- The **navigation bar** should stay at the top and have a small shadow.  
- The **hero section** should have a centered title and a call-to-action button.  
- The **projects section** should be a grid with equal-sized cards.  
- The **contact section** should have a simple form with styled input fields and a submit button.  

## **Styling Details**  
- Buttons and links should have smooth hover effects.  
- Project cards should have a slight shadow and move up a little when hovered.  
- Rounded corners (`border-radius: 8px`) for buttons and cards.  
- Add smooth transitions (`transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out`).  

Please generate a full **CSS file** using these guidelines.
