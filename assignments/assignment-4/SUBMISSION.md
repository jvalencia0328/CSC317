## ðŸ“„ Description

I created a new portfolio(different from what I originally submitted) but it does meet the requirements such as the working links(Project sections).

For the calculator project page, I used a clean and semantic HTML structure. Instead of using traditional <button> elements, I chose to use <div> containers for each calculator button. This gave me more flexibility in applying custom styles and managing the layout using CSS. It also made it easier to assign JavaScript event listeners by targeting specific class names such as number-1, operator addition, and function ac.

The calculator is organized within a main <div class="calculator">, which includes:

A top-container that simulates a mobile phoneâ€™s status bar

A display section to show the current input or result

A button-container that holds all the interactive calculator keys


For my calculatorâ€™s JavaScript, I kept things simple and organized by breaking the code into small functions. Each part of the calculator (like typing numbers, using operators, clearing, or getting a result) has its own function. I used div elements instead of regular buttons and made them respond to clicks with JavaScript.

When a button is clicked, the code checks what kind of button it isâ€”like a number, operator, or equal signâ€”and runs the right function. I also made sure the calculator doesnâ€™t let you type too many digits or divide by zero.
